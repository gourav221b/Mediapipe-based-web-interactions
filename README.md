# MediaPipe Web Demos

This project is a collection of web-based demos showcasing the capabilities of Google's MediaPipe framework. The demos utilize MediaPipe's hand tracking and gesture recognition features to create interactive experiences in the browser.

## Demos

*   **Air Drums:** Play virtual drums in your browser using hand gestures. [Live Demo](https://gourav221b.github.io/Mediapipe-based-web-interactions/)
*   **Simple Hand Tracking:** A basic demonstration of hand tracking using your webcam. [Live Demo](https://gourav221b.github.io/Mediapipe-based-web-interactions/navigation.html)

## Getting Started
